# RotaryTable

A rotating platform for 100Kg/220lbs typical loads.

Possible uses:
--------------
- 3D Scanning of people
- Rotary axis for CNC machining or 3D Printing
- Showroom displays
- Automatic tool changer
- Cake decoration?
- ... and more

Description:
------------
    This platform was initially designed to automate 3D scanning of people and objects with Kinect v2 and 3D Builder. I needed a precision, stepper driven, low profile platform to experiment with various modes of scanning. 

Characteristics (typical):
--------------------------
- platform diameter: 0.5 to 1 meter (2 to 3ft appx) 
- speed: <3 RPM
- Peripheral speed: 25-50mm/s

Parts required (INCOMPLETE!):
-----------------------------
- 1x - 450mm Lazy Susan Aluminum Bearing 500 lbs Turntable Bearings (VXB Brand). Will need to be drilled!
- 1x - Stepper motor driver DM420A 
- 1x - NEMA23, torque: 25 Kg cm (350 oz in). Alternative is a NEMA17 planetary gear motor.
- 4x - M5 30mm (for the NEMA23 mount - alternative is M4 >35mm and nuts)
- 1x - 962MXL Timing Belt, .080" Pitch, 77" Outer Circle, 3/16" Wide (McMaster 1679K685) 
- 2x - M3 20mm with nuts and 2 washers each (for the belt tensioner)
- 4x - F623ZZ: 3x10x4mm flanged bearings (for the belt tensioner)
- 1x - 3D printed part for the NEMA23 mount (STLs in the CAD folder)
- 1x - 3D printed part for the belt tensioner (STLs in the CAD folder)
- 1x - Pulse/Dir/Enable capable electronics (example an Arduino w/ RAMPS shield or Raspberry Pi, etc).
- 6ft - 1" 8020 aluminum extrusion (1010 profile) - with a set of 1/4" screws (1/2 and 3/8) and nuts - this will need to be cut!
